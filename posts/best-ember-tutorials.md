A short summary of all the best article series and tutorial sites to get started with Ember or if you want to expand your knowledge.

Recently an acquaintance of mine asked me how to do a number of very simple things in Ember. So I pointed him to a few tutorial sites (besides the [Ember Guides](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/)) that helped me a lot getting started.

## EmberSCREENCASTS

[https://www.emberscreencasts.com/](https://www.emberscreencasts.com/)

Top of the list and one of the most helpful resources for me was EmberSCREENCASTS. Here you can find comprehensive Video tutorials covering almost all aspects of frontend development with Ember.


## EmberMap

[https://embermap.com/](https://embermap.com/)

EmberMap provides weekly updates and tutorials on new developments and a wide variety of topics. I recommend subscribing to their newsletter to stay up-to-date.


## Ember Igniter

[https://emberigniter.com/](https://emberigniter.com/)

Although a bit outdated, Ember Igniter covers a lot of the basic (and sometimes not so easy to understand) concepts of Ember. Featuring nice graphics and a short concise writing style. I always found it very helpful.


## YoEmber

For an Ember beginner, this a great place to continue after you're done with [the official tutorial from the Ember Docs](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/tutorial/ember-cli/).
