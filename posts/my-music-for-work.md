Over the years working in an office, I've created a few youtube playlists in a number of different styles, some of which I want to share with you.

<!-- more -->

### Classical, Barock, Romanticism

Top of the list for me. Classical music is the thing I listen to most of the time. Mostly no lyrics and mild tunes, hence nothing to get in the way of your thinking when writing difficult logic.

### Jazz

Next down the list, some Jazz tunes and mixes. I only started to follow up on this more recently. Comes really nice when you need a bit of an extra push.

### Disco

Maybe something for bug fixing or overtime to keep you motivated. I feel like I've put most of the great classics into this list, recommendations are always welcome.

### HipHop

My favorite HipHop tunes. Well suited for not so thought-intensive tasks.

### House

Can't have a list like this without some House. This list is pretty old, so forgive me for putting some techno and disco tracks in there too.
