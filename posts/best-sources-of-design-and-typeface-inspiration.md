As a designer and developer, it's hard to stay on top of the latest UI/UX trends, especially when you're trying to integrate your customers' requirements into your designs. Over the past years, I've come across many great resources for design inspiration, that gave me the needed insight at critical moments in a project.

Here I outlined some of the most useful sites and resources I use on a regular basis:

## Dribbble (UI/UX Inspiration)

Dribbble is "Show and Tell" for designers. Since the platform is specifically targeted at digital creatives, it's at the top of the list. It has a very high quality of content, great community and is quite well designed itself. No matter if you're looking for UI/UX, Logo ideas, typeface inspiration or graphic design - Dribbble got you covered

## Typewolf (Typeface Inspiration)

Typewolf is extremely helpful when you're at the stage of figuring out which font or pairs of fonts to use in your project. The articles and recommendations are curated very skillfully. Also, they're featuring quite a lot of Google Fonts, which makes web implementation easier on the developer side. Check out this article for example [A Curated Collection of the 40 Best Google Fonts](https://www.typewolf.com/google-fonts)

## Losttype (Typeface Inspiration & Foundry)

Losttype is a typeface foundry, meaning a collaboration of multiple or a single designer offering to sell the fonts they're creating. The site provides very high-quality fonts, starting with their unique "Pay-What-You-Want" pricing scheme for a Personal Use License. Their fonts have been featured in projects for Nike, Starbucks, Disney and the President of the United States. You can read more in their [about section](http://www.losttype.com/about/).

## Pinterest (UI/UX Inspiration)

Pinterest is a social network specifically for sharing ideas and inspiration, with a whopping 200 million active users a month, it's also one of the largest out there. No wonder you can find all sorts of great inspirational sources, may it be for UI/UX, layout, typefaces or design in general.

Thanks to the kind remarks by a reader, I have another post I would like this share with you. Since some of the sites mentioned above, only offer fonts with a licence fee for commercial purposes, this might help you if you're looking for something free of charge.
