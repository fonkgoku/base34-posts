I gained quite a bit of my knowledge about trading through watching YouTube. Albeit, finding useful information by watching these videos is like trying to find a needle in a hay stack. To make things easier for you, I made a quick list of the Channels that helped me the most over the past two years.

## Trading Rush

By far the newest and most useful Channels of the Bunch. Some guy on the internet just started making very pragmatic videos about his trading style. Extremely straight forward explanations of strategies and psychology. No upselling, no BS.

## Chat with Traders

Technically not just a YouTube Channel but a podcast, Aaron Fifield interviews the best and the brightest in the broad field of trading. With more than 200 episodes, there's plenty of useful material to enjoy.

## The Secret Mindset

Some guy named Marius created this Channel about 2 years ago. It features lots of useful, nicely animated videos about strategy and indicator utilization.

## UKSpreadBetting

British Trader Mark talks not just about spread betting, but about all sorts of trading strategies, ideas and psychology. Very useful content.

Not a lot of videos, but quite interesting. Andrew Lockwood and his crew explain a lot of concepts regarding forex trading. They also offer an exclusive membership to their community at ForexSignals.com.
