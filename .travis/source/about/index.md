Hi! I'm Paul Csapak - Vienna based software developer.

I have more than 5 years of active experience in building rich front-end experiences with a wide variety of tools, both CMS and modern JavaScript frameworks like Ember.js, Angular and React. Recently, I started applying Data Science and Machine Learning tools like PyTorch on financial data.

This blog is my creative and educational outlet, to share my ideas.

Feel free to check out my Github profile [Github](https://github.com/paulcpk "@paulcpk").

I'm available for development and consulting, get in touch at [paul@base34.com](mailto:paul@base34.com).
